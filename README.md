# SEC Form 4 Webscraper
Small script that scrapes information from [Open Insider](http://openinsider.com) and stores it in a pandas dataframe.

## Getting Started
This uses Python 3.12.5, any version above 3.7 *should* work fine.
 
 **1. Clone the repo**
 
 Create a folder or directory and do

 `git clone https://github.com/mcarlton796/sec-scraper.git`

**2. Create a virtual environment (recomended)**

`python -m venv env_name`

**3. Install dependencies**

In the venv, install the required packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt.`

**4. Enjoy** :smile:

This is a fairly open ended script, use this for your trading algorithms or AI training. By the way, the [Open Insider](http://openinsider.com) platform is built off a few APIs from the SEC, you can find more infomration on that [here](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/edgar-application-programming-interfaces).
